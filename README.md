# 🤖 GitChatBot

**AI-Powered Git Assistant & Codebase Companion — built with .NET 9, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI**

GitChatBot is a powerful and extensible **.NET 9 console application** that allows developers to interact naturally with Git repositories, commit history, and codebases using **natural language**. It leverages **Microsoft's Semantic Kernel** to orchestrate plugin functionality and **Azure OpenAI** for intelligent response generation.
<br/><br/>


## ✨ Features

- View recent Git commits and compare changes
- Automatically generate professional release notes from commit history
- Ask questions about the indexed codebase in natural language
- Let the AI choose and invoke the correct tools automatically
- Perform common Git operations: `commit`, `push`, `pull`
- Embed and search code using vector memory (Semantic Search)
- Plugin-based architecture with function auto-selection (via `FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto()`)
<br/><br/>
